Computer Scientist.

My current research is in [natural language generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation) for [African languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Africa). I am also interested in conceptual modelling, knowledge engineering, and human language technologies.

## Recent highlights:

- [Our paper on automatically extracting phonological conditioning rules accepted at DHASA2023](https://dh2023.digitalhumanities.org.za/schedule/)
- [We presented our paper, part of the 'Enterprise Medical Imaging in Zambia' project, at MTSR2023](http://www.mtsr-conf.org/programme)
- [We received a distinguished paper award at FOIS 2023](https://sit.uct.ac.za/articles/2023-07-30-distinguished-paper-award-fois2023-conference)
- [Graduated from CS@UCT -- thesis titled "Foundations for reusable and maintainable surface realisers for isiXhosa and isiZulu"](/files/Thesis.pdf)
- [Published a journal article (ACM TALLIP) on an architecture for surface realisers created for low-resourced langs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3567594)
