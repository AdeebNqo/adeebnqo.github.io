Computer Scientist.

My current research is in [natural language generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation) for [African languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Africa). I am also interested in conceptual modelling, knowledge engineering, and human language technologies.

- [Published a journal article (ACM TALLIP) on an architecture for surface realisers created for low-resourced langs](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3567594) 
- [Contributed to running a tutorial on ontology verbalisation at JOWO2022](http://www.meteck.org/MoReNL/NLGOntologiesTutorialJOWO22.html)
