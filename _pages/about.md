Computer Scientist.

My current research is in [natural language generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation) for [African languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Africa). I am also interested in conceptual modelling, knowledge engineering, and human language technologies.

## Recent highlights:

- [We created algorithms for verbalising numbers in isiZulu + created a novel dataset. Work was presented @ the 17th INLG](https://aclanthology.org/2024.inlg-main.21/)
- [We replicated Gabriel et al.'s work as part of HumEval @ LREC-COLING 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.humeval-1.26/)
- [Our paper on automatically extracting phonological conditioning rules was presented at DHASA2023](https://www.upjournals.up.ac.za/index.php/dhasa/article/view/5013)
- [We presented our paper, part of the 'Enterprise Medical Imaging in Zambia' project, at MTSR2023](http://www.mtsr-conf.org/programme)
- [We received a distinguished paper award at FOIS 2023](https://sit.uct.ac.za/articles/2023-07-30-distinguished-paper-award-fois2023-conference)
