I am a lecturer (US=Assistant professor) at the department of Informatics, University of Pretoria.

I am also a PhD candidate in Computer Science at [UCT](http://www.uct.ac.za/) and a member of Assoc.Prof. Keet's [KnowledgE ENgineering (KEEN)](http://www.meteck.org/keen/index.html). My current research focus is on [natural language generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation") for [Nguni languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguni_languages). I am interested in conceptual modelling and human language technologies.

## Recent highlights:

- [We investigated the association between various types of NLG errors and low human judgements of naturalness and quality for machine learning vs. template generated texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14613)
- [Published a journal article on the formalisation of "grammar-infused templates": they can be used to verbalise ontologies and similar artefacts](https://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~zmahlaza/preprints/ijmso2020preprint.pdf)
- [Presented a long paper on our new isiZulu controlled natural language at WebNLG+2020](https://webnlg-challenge.loria.fr/files/2020.webnlg-papers.2.pdf)

Prior to this, I worked on creating grammar rules for generating weather bulletins in isiXhosa and isiZulu for my [Masters](https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/27997), worked as Software Engineer (Android dev.), and investigated the feasibility of using a Raspberry Pi to host a cloudlet for my [honours](cloudlet1.html)
