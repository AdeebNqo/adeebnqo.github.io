Computer Scientist.

My current research is in [natural language generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation) for [African languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Africa). I am also interested in conceptual modelling, knowledge engineering, and human language technologies.
