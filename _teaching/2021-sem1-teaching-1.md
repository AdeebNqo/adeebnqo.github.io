The course will introduce students to the inner mechanics of a modern programming language compiler or interpreter. Students will learn to appreciate why programming languages are designed in particular ways and they will learn how to develop compilers and compiler-related tools. Course content will include: language classes, formal grammars, parsing, and, time permitting, abstract syntax trees.
