This course introduces students to a variety of concepts within data science using a visual programming environment called RapidMiner. Specifically, the course introduces students to correlation, regression, various clustering models, association rule mining, neural networks, etc. Afterwards, students are expected to be able to use the CRISP-DM methodology to solve a number of problems that one would encounter in-the-wild.
